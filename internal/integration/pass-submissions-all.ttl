Disease progression is not consistent from person to person. Psychosocial factors are hypothesized to play a modifying role. Self-efficacy, the confidence in one’s ability to perform well in a specific life domain or at a specific task, is associated with better health outcomes. Coping self-efficacy is confidence in one’s ability to handle life’s problems through emotional regulation, problem-solving, and social support. Little is known about associations between coping self-efficacy and inflammation. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Aim:</jats:title><jats:p> The purpose of this pilot study was to examine associations between coping self-efficacy and IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α levels. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Method:</jats:title><jats:p> This was a cross-sectional study conducted over two visits. Sociodemographic variables, chronic disease count, body mass index (BMI), and coping self-efficacy were collected. Inflammatory markers were collected via sweat using the sweat patch, a noninvasive collection device. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results:</jats:title><jats:p> Higher TNF-α and IL-10 levels were significantly associated with low coping self-efficacy (β = −.03, p = .028; β = −.017, p = .007, respectively) after adjustment for age, sex, race, BMI, and chronic disease count. IL-6 trended toward significance after adjustment as well (β = −.22, p = .054). </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusions:</jats:title><jats:p> This pilot study showed that high coping self-efficacy was associated with lower IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α levels, indicating a potential buffering effect of high coping self-efficacy. Further longitudinal research with larger sample sizes is needed. </jats:p></jats:sec>\",\"title\":\"High Coping Self-Efficacy Associated With Lower Sweat Inflammatory Cytokines in Adults: A Pilot Study\",\"volume\":\"22\",\"journal-title\":\"Biological Research For Nursing\",\"issns\":[{\"issn\":\"1099-8004\",\"pubType\":\"Print\"},{\"issn\":\"1552-4175\",\"pubType\":\"Online\"}],\"authors\":[{\"author\":\"Melissa Hladek\"},{\"author\":\"Jessica Gill\"},{\"author\":\"Chen Lai\"},{\"author\":\"Kate Lorig\"},{\"author\":\"Sarah Szanton\"}],\"journal-NLMTA-ID\":\"Biol Res Nurs\",\"publicationDate\":\"2019-9-5\",\"doi\":\"10.1177/1099800419870607\",\"$schema\":\"https://oa-pass.github.com/metadata-schemas/jhu/global.json\",\"agent_information\":{\"name\":\"Chrome\",\"version\":\"79\"},\"agreements\":[{\"JScholarship\":\"NON-EXCLUSIVE LICENSE FOR USE OF MATERIALS This non-exclusive license defines the terms for the deposit of Materials in all formats into the digital repository of materials collected, preserved and made available through the Johns Hopkins Digital Repository, JScholarship.
